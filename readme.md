# Bankist Landing Page â€“ Advanced JS DOM Techniques
This mini-project is a modern, interactive landing page for a fictional bank, Bankist, showcasing advanced JavaScript DOM manipulation and UI techniques. It demonstrates how to build a dynamic, user-friendly interface using vanilla JS and CSS, without any frameworks.

## Features:
- **Modal Window:** Open and close modal dialogs for account creation using smooth transitions.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links and buttons scroll smoothly to target sections.
- **Tabbed Component:** Interactive tabs for switching between different banking operations.
- **Menu Fade Animation:** Navigation menu fades sibling links and logo on hover for enhanced UX.
- **Sticky Navigation:** Navigation bar sticks to the top using the Intersection Observer API.
- **Section Reveal on Scroll:** Sections animate into view as the user scrolls down.
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Images load only when about to enter the viewport, improving performance.
- **Slider/Carousel:** Testimonial slider with navigation arrows and clickable dots.
- **Responsive UI Elements:** All UI elements are styled for a clean, minimalist look.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5 (index.html):** Semantic structure for content and layout.
- **CSS3 (style.css):** Custom properties, grid, transitions, and effects for modern styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+) (script.js):** DOM selection, event delegation, Intersection Observer, and dynamic UI logic.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Mastery of DOM selection, traversal, and manipulation.
- Efficient event handling and delegation.
- Implementation of advanced UI patterns (modals, tabs, sliders).
- Performance optimization with lazy loading and intersection observers.
- Clean, maintainable code structure using modern JS best practices.
